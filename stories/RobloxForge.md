# RobloxForge

RobloxForge provides professional collaboration tools for Roblox developers, addressing gaps in source control, localization, and team workflows.[web:64]

## Product Vision
Roblox games reach 50K+ Lua lines without version control or plugins, causing bugs.[web:64] RobloxForge enables pro teams to scale.

## Target Users
- Roblox studios building social/multiplayer games
- Teams exceeding solo dev scale
- Publishers localizing top experiences
- Asset creators needing marketplaces

## Problem Statement
Lua lacks source control; no plugin store; manual localization.[web:64] Pro devs demand Unity-like tools for Roblox's 70M DAU platform.
