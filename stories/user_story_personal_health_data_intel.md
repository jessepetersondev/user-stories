Title: Personal Health Data Intelligence Platform

Description:

Overview
A consumer-facing application that aggregates fragmented personal health data from multiple sources (wearables, medical records, nutrition tracking, genetic testing, pharmacy records) and uses intelligent analysis to deliver proactive, personalized health insights and preventative recommendations.

Problem Statement
Consumers collect health data through 5-10 disconnected platforms but lack tools to transform this fragmented information into actionable preventative guidance. Current health applications focus on single data streams without meaningful cross-source synthesis.

Target Users

Individuals with family health history concerns seeking proactive risk mitigation

People managing chronic conditions requiring multi-factor health monitoring
