# GreenLedger

GreenLedger provides SMB manufacturers with automated Scope 1-3 emissions tracking and CSRD-compliant reporting, filling the gap where enterprise ESG platforms are too complex and expensive.[web:34][web:35]

## Product Vision
New 2026 regulations like CSRD and VSME mandate ESG disclosures for mid-sized firms, but affordable, manufacturing-focused tools are scarce.[web:34] GreenLedger simplifies data collection from ERP/utilities/suppliers into audit-ready reports.

## Target Users
- SMB manufacturing owners (50-500 employees) facing supplier ESG demands
- Supply chain managers tracking Scope 3 emissions
- Operations leads handling energy/utility data
- Finance teams preparing CSRD/VSME filings

## Problem Statement
SMBs lack integrated ESG data from disparate sources (ERP, bills, suppliers), making Scope 3 calculations manual and error-prone.[web:34][web:35] Enterprise software starts at €50K/year with steep learning curves; spreadsheets fail audits.[web:36]

## Core Value Proposition
Achieve CSRD compliance in weeks, not months. Automate 80% of emissions math, generate buyer-ready reports, and turn sustainability into competitive advantage for contracts.[web:34]
