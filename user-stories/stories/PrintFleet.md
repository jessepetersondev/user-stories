# PrintFleet

PrintFleet orchestrates multi-printer 3D farms for SMB makers, centralizing job scheduling, monitoring, and cost tracking amid 2026 AM software scaling needs.[web:45][web:53]

## Product Vision
SMB print farms struggle with manual coordination across printers, leading to downtime and inefficiency.[web:53] PrintFleet provides cloud orchestration for seamless scaling.

## Target Users
- SMB print service bureaus (5-50 printers)
- Makerspace operators managing shared farms
- Prototype shops optimizing workflows
- Etsy/custom part sellers scaling production

## Problem Statement
No affordable software unifies slicing, queuing, monitoring for heterogeneous farms (Bambu, Prusa, etc.). Manual USB/SD management wastes 40% time; farm growth stalls at 10 printers.[web:53][web:56]

## Core Value Proposition
Boost utilization 30%, cut labor 50%. Auto-schedule jobs, predict maintenance, optimize nesting/materials for profitable scaling.[web:45]
